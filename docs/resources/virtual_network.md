# latitudesh_virtual_network (Resource)

Private networking lets you group servers within the same location, enabling private communication between them.

See more in the Latitude.sh docs: https://www.latitude.sh/docs/networking/private-networks

## Example usage

```terraform
data "latitudesh_region" "region" {
  slug = "sao2"
}

resource "latitudesh_project" "project" {
  name        = "Project name"
  description = "Description of project"
  environment = "Development" # Development, Production or Staging
}

resource "latitudesh_virtual_network" "virtual_network" {
  description = "Virtual Network description"

  # You can use ID or slug for both:
  site    = data.latitudesh_region.region.slug
  project = latitudesh_project.project.id
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `description` (String) The virtual network description
- `project` (String) The project id or slug
- `site` (String) The site id or slug

### Optional

- `tags` (List of String) List of virtual network tags

### Read-Only

- `assignments_count` (Number) Amount of devices assigned to the virtual network
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `vid` (Number) The vlan ID of the virtual network

## Detecting changes made outside of Terraform

If resources were modified in Latitude.sh (UI/API) or by other tools, you can reconcile state with **refresh-only**:

1. Preview what changed:
   ```sh
   terraform plan -refresh-only
   ```
2. Apply the refresh to update state without changing real infrastructure:
   ```sh
   terraform apply -refresh-only
   ```

> **Heads-up on timing:** When assigning a device to a virtual network, the assignment status may take a short time to propagate. Running a refresh-only plan helps confirm when the assignment is completed.

## Import

You can import a Virtual Network resource using either the CLI method or the new [experimental import block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import).

**CLI Import**

The `latitudesh_virtual_network` resource can be imported by specifying its ID:

```sh
terraform import latitudesh_virtual_network.virtual_network <VIRTUAL_NETWORK_ID>
```

**Import Block (Experimental)**

Terraform v1.5.0 and later supports the experimental import block, which allows you to define imports in your configuration. This feature is experimental and may change in future Terraform releases. See the [Terraform documentation for details](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import).

To use this method, create a file named `import.tf` (or any `.tf` file) with the following content:

```hcl
import {
  to = latitudesh_virtual_network.virtual_network
  id = "<VIRTUAL_NETWORK_ID>"
}
```

Then run:

```sh
terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated_virtual_network.tf
```

This will generate the resource configuration for the imported virtual network resource.

> **Note:** The import block feature is experimental and its syntax or behavior may change in future Terraform versions.
